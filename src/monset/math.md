# Math Formula Rendering

To render mathematical formulas into image files, use the following syntax:

```monset
math "your_math_expression" > path/to/output.png
```

For example, to render the formula `2 + 2 = 4`, the command would look like this:

```monset
math "2 + 2 = 4" > path/to/output.png
```

This command will generate an image of the math expression and save it to the specified file path. Make sure to replace `"your_math_expression"` with the actual math expression you want to render, and adjust the file path as needed.
