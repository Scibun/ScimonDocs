# Covers

To extract covers, use the following derivative:

```monset
covers "path/to/covers"
```

> Covers depends on the `pdfium-render` binaries. Make sure to have the library installed in your machine. [Click here](https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries) to learn how to install it.

> Covers are extracted from the files and stored in the specified directory.

## How It Works

The `covers` derivative allows you to specify a directory or path where the covers of the files should be extracted and stored. Simply assign the desired path to the derivative.
