# Style

Simply use the `style` variable followed by the valid URL of the CSS file, and this will apply the defined style to the document:

```monset
style "https://example.com/path/to/custom_style.css"
```

With this configuration, the CSS file at the specified URL will be used to style the generated PDF. Ensure the URL is accessible and points to a valid CSS file.
