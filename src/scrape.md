# Scrape

## Scrape Option

The `--scrape` option in Scimon enables scraping functionality, allowing you to extract information or data from a specified URL.

### Usage:

To initiate a scraping operation on a specific URL, you use the `--url` flag followed by the URL you want to scrape, along with the `--scrape` flag.

#### Example Command:

```shell
scimon --url https://scibun.com --scrape
```

In this command:

- `https://scibun.com` should be replaced with the URL you want to perform the scraping on.

### Functionality:

When you execute the command with the `--url` and `--scrape` flags, Scimon will visit the specified URL and extract relevant information based on predefined scraping rules or patterns.

### Result:

The result of the scraping operation depends on the specific implementation and configuration of Scimon. It could involve extracting text, images, links, or other structured data from the webpage.

### Additional Notes:

- Scimon provides flexibility in configuring scraping rules and patterns to suit your specific requirements.
- Ensure that you have proper permissions or authorization to scrape the content of the specified URL to comply with legal and ethical guidelines.

By utilizing the `--scrape` option in Scimon, you can automate the process of extracting valuable information from webpages, streamlining tasks such as data collection, content aggregation, and web monitoring.
